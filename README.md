# primary_backup
Implement a replicated key-value store in Go using Primay backup replication design. 
The goal of the project was to implement a working Primary backup replicated client-server set up in order to understand basic concepts 
pertaining to distributed systems. 
Specifically, I explored ways to achieve linearizable consistency in the presence of network partition, split brain and other typical failure scenarios in a 
distributed system setting.
